# Laplacian-and-Gaussian-Pyramid-Image-Compression
Implementation and analysis of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids for image compression, reconstruction, quantization, and entropy studies based on the methods described in Burt's "Pyramid Methods in Image Processing" (1981) and Burt &amp; Adelson's "The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code" (1983).
